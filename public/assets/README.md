## üì¶ Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/omazon-clone.git
   cd omazon-clone
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** for both frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # Backend
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/amazon_clone"
   SESSION_SECRET="your_session_secret"
   ```

   - Replace `USER` and `PASSWORD` with your PostgreSQL username and password.

4. **Set up the database**:
   - Install PostgreSQL if you haven‚Äôt already. On most systems, you can do this with:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
     ```

   - Create a PostgreSQL database:
     ```bash
     sudo -u postgres psql
     CREATE DATABASE amazon_clone;
     \q
     ```

5. **Run database migrations**:

   Use Prisma to create the necessary tables in your database.

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

6. **Start the application**:

   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm run dev
     ```

   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm run dev
     ```

7. **Creating a User**:
   Once the backend and database are set up, you can create a new user by signing up through the front-end interface. Navigate to the registration page and create your account.

8. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port Vite is using) to interact with the app.
